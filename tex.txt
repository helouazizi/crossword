1. Parse the Puzzle Input:
The first task is to parse the empty crossword puzzle (passed as a string) into a more manageable data structure, such as a 2D array. This will help with easier manipulation and access while solving the puzzle.

Split the string by newline (\n) to break it into rows.
Split each row into individual characters to form a 2D array.
2. Validate the Input:
Check that the emptyPuzzle contains only valid characters (0-9, ., \n).
Ensure that the length of the words array matches the number of words to be placed in the puzzle.
If there is a mismatch in expected puzzle structure or word count, print Error.
3. Extract Word Positions:
Based on the numbers in the puzzle (0-9), determine where each word should go. Each number indicates the start of a word. You will need to check both horizontal and vertical placements:

For horizontal placement: Look for rows with numbers and check the sequence of cells in the row where the word should be inserted.
For vertical placement: Look for columns with numbers and check the sequence of cells in the column.
4. Backtracking Algorithm:
Since crossword puzzles can have multiple solutions or no solutions, backtracking can be used to try placing words in different positions and checking if the puzzle is solved:

Place the word in the possible location.
After each placement, check if the puzzle is still valid (no overlaps with existing words, etc.).
If a valid placement is found, continue to the next word. If no valid placement is possible, backtrack by removing the word and trying the next possible placement.
5. Fill the Puzzle:
Once a valid placement for all words is found, modify the puzzle's 2D array and join it back into a string with the filled-in words.

6. Check for Errors:
If it's impossible to solve the puzzle (i.e., no valid word placement is found), print Error.
Ensure that the puzzle is completely filled before printing the solution.
7. Output the Solution:
After successfully filling the puzzle, print the solution as a string, preserving the line breaks (\n) and any unfilled spaces (.).

8. Edge Cases:
Handle cases where there are no valid placements.
Handle cases where there are extra or missing words in the list.
Ensure the words fit within the grid based on the numbers in the puzzle.
